  // Frequently Asked Questions
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  faq: [
    {
      question: "How far in advance should I place my cake order?",
      answer: "For wedding and multi-tier cakes, we recommend booking 2 to 6 months in advance to reserve your event date. For birthday and celebration cakes, a minimum of 1 to 2 weeks notice is preferred. If you need a last-minute order, please message us directly on WhatsApp and we will accommodate if our baking schedule allows!"
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer delivery or is it studio pickup only?",
      answer: "We offer both! Fragile multi-tier wedding and event cakes include professional climate-controlled delivery and on-site setup within our local delivery zone. Bento cakes, cupcakes, and smaller single-tier cakes can be scheduled for pickup directly at our studio."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the design from a Pinterest or Instagram reference?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! We love bringing your inspirations to life. You can share reference photos, wedding invitations, color palettes, or theme boards via WhatsApp or our inquiry form. While we respect original artist copyrights, we will design an exclusive bespoke interpretation uniquely tailored to you."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer cake tastings and consultations?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer tasting sample boxes for wedding couples featuring 4 to 6 of our signature sponge and filling pairings. In-person and virtual WhatsApp design consultations can be scheduled once your event date has been tentatively checked for availability."
    },
    {
      question: "What is your booking and deposit policy?",
      answer: "To secure your event date on our baking calendar, a 50% retainer deposit is required along with a confirmed design agreement. The remaining balance is due 14 days prior to delivery/pickup. We accept bank transfers, credit cards, and cash upon arrangement."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you accommodate dietary requirements or allergies?",
      answer: "We offer gluten-friendly, egg-conscious, and nut-aware recipe options. However, please note that our bakery kitchen processes wheat, dairy, eggs, and tree nuts. If you or any of your guests have severe life-threatening allergies, please let us know during your initial inquiry."
